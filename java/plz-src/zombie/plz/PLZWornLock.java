/**
 * PLZ. Body locations a named account may not have emptied: the registry consulted by
 * {@code WornItems.setItem} before it takes anything off.
 *
 * <p>WHAT IT IS FOR. Spiffo mode puts a costume head on and the point of it is that the head stays
 * on. Vanilla takes a head piece off in three separate ways and none of them ask permission: eating,
 * drinking or smoking queues an unequip and a re-wear around the action; wearing anything the body
 * location group calls exclusive with it silently evicts it; and any Lua that strips a player - a
 * police search, a jail intake, a duty locker - calls {@code removeWornItem} and is obeyed.
 *
 * <p>WHY THE GUARD IS IN {@code WornItems} AND NOT IN {@code IsoGameCharacter}. Those three routes
 * meet in exactly one method. {@code IsoGameCharacter.setWornItem} is only the first of them;
 * {@code SyncClothingPacket.process} rebuilds a character's worn list by replaying
 * {@code WornItems.setItem} for every entry in the packet, which is how a REMOTE player's clothing
 * is put together on every client and on the server, and {@code setFromItemVisuals} does the same
 * from a visual list. A guard anywhere above that would hold on the wearer's own screen and nowhere
 * else, because the very next packet would rebuild the list with the exclusivity applied again.
 *
 * <p>WHICH IS ALSO WHY THE LOCK IS KEYED BY ACCOUNT AND NOT BY OBJECT. A client has to apply it to
 * somebody ELSE's character, so the key has to be something the client already knows about them.
 * {@code WornItems} carries no owner of its own, so it is stamped with one - see
 * {@code WornItems.plzSetOwner} - from the packet path and from Lua.
 *
 * <p>IT LOCKS A LOCATION, NOT AN ITEM. Whatever is worn at a locked location is pinned, so the rule
 * survives the costume being swapped for another one, and needs no item id on the wire. Turning
 * Spiffo mode off clears the account's whole set.
 *
 * <p>CLIENT AND SERVER BOTH. The server is what refuses a search; every client is what draws two
 * head pieces at once instead of one.
