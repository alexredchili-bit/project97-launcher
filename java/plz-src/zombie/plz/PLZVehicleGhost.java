/**
 * Reporting for vehicles a client is sending physics for that the server cannot resolve.
 *
 * <p>WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is deliberately NOT a corrective action, and that is the whole design
 * decision. The obvious repair - answer with {@code VehicleRemove} - is unsafe for the case that
 * actually happens. {@code VehicleRemovePacket.processClient} runs four steps, and the first,
 * {@code BaseVehicle.removeFromWorld()}, returns EARLY when any passenger is a local
 * {@code IsoPlayer.players[]} - after it has already broken the constraints and marked the vehicle
 * unloaded in {@code VehiclesDB2}. The other three steps ({@code removeFromSquare},
 * {@code unregisterVehicle}) then run regardless. {@code serverRemovedFromWorld} does not rescue
 * this: it is written in exactly two places and read in none, so it gates nothing.
 *
 * <p>A client sending vehicle physics is, in the ordinary case, DRIVING - so the occupied branch is
 * the common one, not the rare one. Sending the remove would leave the car half torn down on the
 * screen of the one player guaranteed to be looking at it, which is how a rubber-band becomes the
 * freeze-and-die that {@code vehicleChunkRehome} exists to fix. Trading a recoverable symptom for
 * an unrecoverable one is not a repair.
 *
 * <p>So this reports instead, because the root cause - why a vehicle being driven is not registered
 * on the server - is still unknown, and 113 identical log lines in 37 s is not evidence anybody can
 * work from. One line per vehicle per window, carrying the suppressed count and the driver's name,
 * is.
 *
 * <p>COST. {@link #report} is reached only from the {@code !isConsistent} branch of
 * {@code PacketTypes.onServerPacket}, which returns without calling {@code processServer}. A packet
 * that resolves normally never touches this class, so there is no cost on the hot path at all.
 * Measured on live: 119 such packets in 4.72 h, peaking at ~3/s for one vehicle.
