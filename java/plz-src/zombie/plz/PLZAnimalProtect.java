/**
 * Whether a player may harm somebody else's animal.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is a patch and not Lua.</b> Every other way of taking an animal - leading it,
 * trailering it, butchering it - is a timed action with a {@code complete()} a wrapper can
 * refuse. Damage is not. A swing lands in {@code IsoAnimal.hitConsequences} with no Lua seam
 * anywhere on the path, so without this a protected horse could not be ridden, led or loaded by
 * a stranger and could still be beaten to death by one.
 *
 * <p><b>It is NOT a registry of animals.</b> The obvious shape - push every protected animal to
 * java - cannot work: an animal id is not durable ({@code animalId} is {@code Rand.Next(10000)}
 * and collides inside one farm, and {@code onlineId} is only allocated against LOADED animals),
 * and the set would have to be rebuilt for every animal that streams in. So the OWNER is read
 * off the animal in hand, which is exact and free, and the only thing pushed from Lua is the
 * small per-player answer java cannot compute: which owner keys a given username may act for.
 * That is their own name, every business they belong to, and every household they are in - all
 * of which live in the faction and property ledgers, which are Lua.
 *
 * <p><b>Rebuild-and-swap, never patched in place.</b> {@link #begin}, {@link #add} then
 * {@link #apply}: a half-built map is never the live one. Same shape as {@code PLZVehicleAccess}
 * and {@code PLZDoorAccess}, and for the same reason.
 *
 * <p><b>Fail-open on every uncertainty.</b> Disabled, no animal, no wielder, an unowned animal,
 * or a lookup that throws - all allow. This runs inside a combat path; a mistake here that
 * refused would make a zombie-mauled chicken unkillable, which is worse than the theft it exists
 * to stop.
