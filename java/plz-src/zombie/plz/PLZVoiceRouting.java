/**
 * Keeps the NATIVE voice routing table current, instead of paying for its staleness in range.
 *
 * <p>WHAT THE PROBLEM ACTUALLY IS. Whether a voice packet is transmitted at all is decided in
 * native code: {@code GameServer.receiveSyncRadioData} hands the publisher's routing table to
 * {@code RakVoice.SetChannelsRouting}, and the native voice server routes from it. That table
 * arrives from the client once every {@code GameClient.updateChannelsRoamingLimit} - 3010 ms of
 * untouched vanilla - and carries whole-tile positions. So the audibility decision upstream of
 * everything the client does runs on positions up to 3.01 s old. Standing still that is invisible.
 * At 130 km/h a car covers ~108 tiles inside one interval, and because two entries publish on
 * INDEPENDENT timers, two people sharing one vehicle can be a full interval out of step with each
 * other - which is why they go mute at speed while sitting in the same seat row.
 *
 * <p>WHY THIS NO LONGER WIDENS THE RANGE. The obvious compensation is to inflate the published
 * range by the drift. It works and it is unshippable: covering both parties at speed means a
 * ~216-tile proximity range, and the range is what decides who the native server sends voice
 * frames to, so a handful of fast drivers would be broadcasting to most of the loaded cell.
 *
 * <p>The staleness is not worth paying for, because <b>the server already knows where everybody
 * actually is</b>. {@code UdpConnection.players} are the authoritative characters. So the position
 * in the routing table is overwritten from them, and {@link #refresh} re-pushes on a short timer.
 * {@code SetChannelsRouting} is a local native setter - re-pushing costs no packets, and the
 * 3010 ms SyncRadioData rebroadcast to every connection is left exactly as it was. What remains is
 * a position no more than one refresh period old, so {@link #SLACK_TILES} only has to cover that
 * much travel rather than a full routing interval.
 *
 * <p>ONLY PROXIMITY ENTRIES ARE TOUCHED. A publisher's table also carries radio devices, including
 * world radios on squares that are not moving at all; their positions are already correct and are
 * not the publisher's. {@link PLZVoice#isVoiceChannel} separates the two. A range already published
 * as zero is left at zero - that is a decision (a different floor, or a private call), not a
 * distance, exactly as {@code PLZVoice.gateRange} treats it.
