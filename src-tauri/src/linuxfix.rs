/// LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libwayland-client.so.0 ./Project-97-Launcher_x.y.z_amd64.AppImage
/// ```
///
/// The AppImage is built on Ubuntu 22.04 and carries that distribution's Wayland client library
/// with it. On a machine whose compositor is newer - `/usr/lib64` in the report above is a
/// Fedora/openSUSE layout, not Ubuntu's - the bundled copy is the older of the two and the window
/// never paints. Preloading the system one puts the pair back in step.
///
/// LD_PRELOAD is read by the dynamic loader at exec time, so it cannot be set from inside a
/// process that is already running: the only way to apply it to ourselves is to start again. That
/// is what this does, once, and only when every one of these holds:
///
/// - we are running from an AppImage at all (`APPIMAGE` is set by its runtime),
/// - the session is Wayland, so the library is actually in play,
/// - `LD_PRELOAD` is unset, so a player already doing this by hand is left alone,
/// - the marker is unset, so the re-executed process does not do it again,
/// - the opt-out is unset,
/// - and a system libwayland-client actually exists to point at.
///
/// Any of those missing, or the exec failing, and the launcher carries on exactly as before. The
/// cost when it does fire is one extra AppImage mount at startup.
